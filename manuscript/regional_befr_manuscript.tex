\section{Introduction}

% BEFR is important to study, setting the scene - DONE
Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function has become a central endeavour in ecological science, as we seek to predict the consequences of global biodiversity change \citep{Naeem2012}. Over the past two decades, study of the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function Relationship (BEFR) has grown from small-scale experimental studies mostly in temperate grasslands \citep{Cardinale2009, Tilman1994, Tilman2014}, to observational studies in natural ecosystems \citep{Plas2019}. While positive BEFRs which align with theory have been frequently reported, a complex picture has emerged whereby the strength and direction of the BEFR varies depending on the ecosystem studied \citep{Liang2016}, the ecosystem function(s) of interest \citep{Hector2007}, and the inclusion of environmental covariates in statistical models \citep{Vila2005}. The goal now should be to study the BEFR in different environmental and ecological contexts, in order to develop an ecosystem-agnostic understanding of the complex interactions between biodiversity, abiotic environment, and ecosystem function.

% Ecosystem function definition and mechanisms of the BEFR - DONE
Ecosystem functions are defined in broad terms as rate processes and aggregate properties of ecosystems that describe the nature of biotic activity within those ecosystems \citep{Jax2005}. Woody productivity and biomass storage are two of the most commonly studied ecosystem functions in forests and other wooded ecosystems (e.g. savannas) \citep{Brockerhoff2017}, due to their importance in the global carbon cycle \citep{Pan2011} and their potential leverage as a tool to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic climate change while maintaining biodiversity \citep{Pichancourt2013}. Theory predicts that biodiversity will have a positive effect on ecosystem function via three principle mechanisms: 1) niche complementarity, whereby niche partitioning and ecosystem resource use efficiency is increased in diverse communities, minimising negative density dependent effects such as intraspecific competition and abundance of species-specific natural enemies \citep{Barry2019}; 2) selection effects, whereby diverse communities are more likely to include a high-yield species; and 3) facilitation effects, whereby diverse communities are more likely to contain species combinations which enhance each others' functional contribution \citep{Wright2017}. 

There has been extended debate on whether positive BEFRs should be expected in all wooded ecosystems \citep{Liang2016}. In temperate and wet tropical forests, where the majority of BEFR studies in natural forest ecosystems have been conducted \citep{Plas2019}, the mechanism of niche complementarity, which contributes the majority of the observed biodiversity effect \citep{Poorter2015, Sande2017a, Wright2017}, hinges on the condition that intraspecific competition between trees is the limiting factor to ecosystem functioning, but this may not hold true in all systems. 

Disturbance-driven mesic savannas and open canopy woodlands cover >20\% of the global land surface \citep{Pennington2018, Solbrig1996}, and represent the dominant vegetation type in Africa, spanning >4 million km\textsuperscript{2} \citep{White1987, Ratnam2011, Ryan2016} (\autoref{clust_map}). Taken together, the above- and below-ground carbon stored in African mesic savannas may be comparable to that found in the wet forests of the Congo basin \citep{Houghton2009, Mayaux2008, Spawn2020}. Despite their global importance however, African mesic savannas are severely under-represented in BEFR studies \citep{Clarke2017, Liang2016}. In savannas disturbance by fire \citep{Lehmann2014} and herbivory \citep{Sankaran2008, Levick2009} reduces woody stem density and biomass, diminishing competitive interactions between individuals, allowing competitors to co-exist where they would normally be excluded \citep{Grime1979, Grace1990}. It is possible that a threshold woody stem density exists below which the lack of competition precludes the detection of a biodiversity effect on ecosystem function via niche differentiation. Instead, stress tolerance and the functional contribution of particular species (selection effects) may be the predominant biotic forces influencing ecosystem function in these ecosystems \citep{Lasky2014, Tobner2016}. Additionally, stressful environments appear to lessen the role of both niche complementarity and facilitation effects in driving the BEFR, by replacing competition between individuals with stress tolerance as the limiting factor on functional contribution \citep{Ratcliffe2017, Paquette2011}. This potential mismatch in the contribution of different mechanisms to the BEFR among resource-, disturbance-, and competition-limited ecosystems requires further investigation if we are to derive a generalisable BEFR.

A number of studies in miombo woodlands, the dominant mesic savanna type in southern Africa \citep{Campbell1996}, have found that above-ground woody carbon/biomass stocks correlate positively with tree species richness \citep{McNicol2018, Shirima2015, Mutowo2012}. These studies however, lacked the spatial extent required to account for the interacting effects of variation in abiotic environment, disturbance regime, and biogeography which are expected to affect the BEFR. Studies of the BEFR often find that within a small spatial extent (<2500 km\textsuperscript{2}), biodiversity shows a strong effect on ecosystem function, but at broader extents (>100,000s km\textsuperscript{2}) biodiversity effects pale in significance compared to abiotic factors such as climate \citep{Gonzalez2020}. In West Africa, \citet{Mensah2020} found that woodlands and forests showed a positive effect of tree species richness on above-ground carbon, while open savannas did not, implying that stem density and the presence of dominant large trees may affect the strength of the observed BEFR. In the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, \citet{Loiola2015} found that disturbance by fire reduced tree productivity via its effect on functional trait values. In contrast however, \citet{Carvalho2014} also working in the Brazilian Cerrado, found that while disturbance by fire did reduce soil fertility, which is often closely related to productivity in savannas, functional trait diversity was unaffected by fire frequency. Other studies focussing on the herbaceous diversity in disturbance-prone grasslands in North America and Europe have shown that disturbance by fire, mowing and herbivory reduces herbaceous productivity \citep{Grace2007}, and allows for weak competitors to co-exist \citep{Mason2011}. While these studies together offer some glimpse into how the BEFR may operate in disturbance-prone systems, none provide a full and comprehensive assessment of the interacting effects of diversity, abiotic environment, disturbance and ecosystem function, particularly for wooded ecosystems. Additionally, due to differences in community assembly, evolutionary history and contemporary drivers between the neotropics and the African tropics, inferences from one continent cannot necessarily be applied to the other \citep{Dexter2015}.

% Environment affects the BEFR, so must be accounted for.
%As well as variation in disturbance regime, southern African savannas occur over a wide range of precipitation, temperature, and soil conditions \citep{Campbell1996}. Environmental heterogeneity has been shown to affect both woody biomass and tree species diversity independently, across a number of different biomes \citep{Spasojevic2014, Michaletz2018, Michaletz2014}. It is important therefore to account for environmental heterogeneity and understand how it influences both biomass and biodiversity to effectively model and correctly attribute the effects of biodiversity on woody biomass. \citet{Sankaran2005} and \citet{Lehmann2014} both report that total precipitation sets the upper limit for woody biomass in African savannas. \citet{Lehmann2014} also report complex indirect relationships between climate, disturbance by fire and woody biomass, demonstrating the need for directional multi-facetted modelling techniques to properly account for the effects of climate on ecosystem function in this system. 

% In this study :::
In this study, we make the first known estimation of the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function Relationship (BEFR) in disturbance-driven wooded ecosystems (savannas and woodlands) across southern Africa. We aim to understand the synergistic effects of environmental and biotic drivers of variation in the BEFR, with a view to generating a general model of the BEFR in disturbance-prone wooded ecosystems, which is currently lacking in the BEFR literature. We posit three hypotheses: (1) water availability and soil fertility will indirectly positively affect woody biomass via an increase in tree species diversity, (2) the effect of tree species diversity on woody biomass will increase with organismal density (number of stems ha\textsuperscript{-1}), as competitive interactions become more pronounced as stem proximity increases. Relatedly, we expect that an increase in disturbance by fire will decrease stem density and therefore competition, weakening the effect of tree species diversity on woody biomass. Finally, we expect that (3) tree species diversity will increase tree structural diversity (i.e. physiognomic diversity), providing an indirect path by which tree diversity increases woody biomass.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Study location}

% Situation - DONE
The study used \nplots{} woodland monitoring plots from a larger pool of 5395 plots in the larger SEOSAW database \citep{SEOSAW2020}, located across 10 countries within southern Africa in the miombo ecoregion (\autoref{clust_map}, \citealp{White1987}). The study area spans the core climate space of the region, with a precipitation gradient from c. 460 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} in southern Mozambique and southern Zimbabwe to c. 1700 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} in northern Zambia, Malawi and northern Mozambique. A 2D convex hull of Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) of the study sites covers \hullcover{}\% of the pixel-wise climate space of the miombo woodland ecoregion \citep{White1987}, using WorldClim estimates of Mean Annual Temperature (MAT, BIO1) and Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP, BIO12) between 1970 and 2000 with a pixel size of 30 arc seconds (926 m at equator) \citep{Fick2017}. 

% Plots chosen - DONE
Plots were chosen from the SEOSAW database based on the quality and completeness of data collection, and plot configuration. Plot vegetation was identified under the broad term of `savanna', which includes `woodland', `savanna woodland', and `tree savanna', variously defined in other areas of the scientific literature and here referred to collectively as southern African woodlands \citep{Ratnam2011, Hill2010}. Plots with evidence of farming, human resource extraction or experimental treatments such as prescribed burning or herbivore exclusion were excluded from the initial pool. Only plots >0.1 hectares were used in analyses, as area-based biomass estimation from small plots is highly influenced by rare large trees \citep{Stegen2011}, leading to inaccurate biomass estimates. Only plots with a stem density >50 trees ha\textsuperscript{-1} (>10 cm stem diameter) were used, to ensure all plots represented woodland rather than `grassy savanna', which is considered here a separate biome with very different species composition \citep{Parr2014}. \nzam{} plots within the SEOSAW database were arranged in clusters of four 20x50 m plots, with 20 m between plots. Plots within each spatial cluster were combined and treated as a single plot in analyses, resulting in \nzamcluster{} aggregate plots which were then subject to the plot filtering process described above.

\subsection{Data collection}
 
% AGB
We considered only trees and shrubs in our calculations of Above-Ground woody Biomass (AGB), including woody species such as palms and cycads, which are functionally tree-like. Woody lianas are scarce in our study plots and were not measured. Only stems >10 cm DBH (Diameter at Breast Height, 1.3 m) were included in analyses. Many plots in the dataset did not include data on stems <10 cm DBH. For those plots which contained stem measurements <10 cm DBH, small stems only accounted for a median of \percsmallagb{}\% of the plot level AGB. 

% Number of stems
All stems >10 cm DBH were measured within each plot resulting in a total of \num[group-separator={,}]{\ntrees{}} stems with measurements. A tree may be comprised of multiple stems and so tree-level richness estimates, rather than stem-level estimates, were used to prevent bias from species which readily coppice. For each tree, we recorded species, DBH and tree height to the top of the highest branch material. Height was measured through a variety of means including laser rangefinders, manual clinometers and measuring sticks. When DBH could not be measured at 1.3 m due to trunk abnormalities, it was measured at the closest regular portion of the trunk to 1.3 m. The height of this measurement was recorded and used to estimate the DBH\textsubscript{e} at 1.3 m using a cubic polynomial regression, with parameters estimated using a test dataset from Ryan C., (unpublished), see \citet{Godlee2020}.

% AGB Calculation
AGB for each plot (t ha\textsuperscript{-1}) was calculated using \autoref{chave_agb}, taken from \citet{Chave2014}:

\begin{equation}
	AGB = 0.0673 \times (\rho D^{2} H)^{0.976}
	\label{chave_agb}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the species mean wood density (g cm\textsuperscript{-3}), $D$ is the DBH\textsubscript{e} (cm) at 1.3 m, and $H$ is the tree height (m). Wood density estimates were taken from the global wood density database for each species where possible \citep{Chave2009, Zanne2009}. Wood density for species without species level estimates was estimated from the means of their respective genera. For stems where tree height was unknown, the plots' climatic parameters, estimated from plot location, were used to estimate tree height, according to \citet{Chave2014}.

% WorldClim, SoilGrids and MODIS
Climatic data were taken from the WorldClim database, using the BioClim variables \citep{Fick2017}. In addition to MAT and MAP, temperature stress was calculated as the mean diurnal temperature range (BIO2) and precipitation seasonality was calculated as the mean of the coefficient of variation of monthly mean precipitation (BIO15). Soil fertility data were extracted from the ISRIC gridded soil information data product at 250 m resolution, taking the grid cell value for each plot centre \citep{Hengl2017}. We extracted Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) (cmolc kg\textsuperscript{-1}), soil organic carbon stocks (kg m\textsuperscript{-2}) percentage soil sand content (0.05-2 mm) by weight and soil nitrogen content (g kg\textsuperscript{-1}). These data are a modelled product derived from various remotely sensed and directly measured data sources. The degree of fire disturbance was calculated using the MODIS monthly burned area product at 500 m resolution (MCD64A1, \citealt{MODIS_burn}), counting the total number of times the plot pixel was classified as burning, between 2001 and 2018. We initially aimed to include disturbance by herbivory in our model, including total herbivore biomass from the \citet{Hempson2017} modelled herbivory product, but this inclusion prevented models from converging due to its collinearity with other observed variables, notably MAP and disturbance by fire. 

\subsection{Data analysis}

\subsubsection{Species diversity and structural diversity metrics}

Estimated tree species richness was calculated for each plot using `ChaoRichness()' from the `iNEXT' package in R \citep{Hsieh2016}. This procedure uses Hill numbers of the order $q=0$ \citep{Jost2006} to extrapolate a species rarefaction curve to its predicted asymptote and uses this value as its estimated species richness value. Extrapolated species richness accounts for variation in plot size present in the dataset (0.1-10 ha) and therefore sampling effort among plots. Larger plots will tend to encompass more individuals, and therefore more species \citep{Dengler2009}. To measure tree species evenness, the Shannon Equitability index ($E_{H'}$) \citep{Smith1996} was calculated as the ratio of the estimated Shannon diversity index to the natural log of estimated species richness. Abundance evenness allows for greater niche complementarity at small scales due to potentially increased heterogeneity of functional traits. In terms of the theory of niche complementarity, both species richness and abundance evenness contribute to the positive total diversity effect on ecosystem function. Holding either species richness or abundance evenness constant while increasing the other will have the identical effect of reducing the likelihood that a neighbour is a conspecific, thus reducing the occurrence of negative density dependent competition effects and therefore increasing ecosystem function. We quantified tree structural diversity for each plot by calculating the Coefficient of Variation of DBH (DBH CoV) and tree height (Height CoV). 

\subsubsection{Vegetation clusters}

Plots were assigned to vegetation type groups based on tree species composition. Groups were defined in a manner adapted from \citet{Fayolle2018} in an Africa-wide analysis of floristic units using plot data in savannas and woodlands with tree species diversity and relative abundance data. Group identification was conducted using unconstrained correspondence analysis, followed by hierarchical clustering based on dominant ordination axes. Plot data used in this study occurred in four compositional vegetation types. See \autoref{clust_summ} for a description of each vegetation cluster and \autoref{clust_map} for the spatial distribution of plots from each of these clusters. Cluster names were assigned post-hoc based on the dominant and indicator species in each cluster.


\subsubsection{Structural Equation Modelling}

We used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to investigate the determinants of AGB. All SEMs were constructed and analysed in the `lavaan' package \citep{lavaan} in R version 3.6.0 \citep{R2019}. SEM was used because of its suitability for modelling complex causal interactions in ecological systems \citep{Lee2007}. A key aspect to our decision to use SEM is that they can explicitly model and partition variance attributed to indirect effects, which is challenging in standard multiple regressions. Using SEMs also allowed us to describe latent variables such as `water availability', `soil fertility', and `disturbance' which have been suggested to act upon biodiversity and biomass/productivity in previous studies despite these factors not having directly observable measures in our dataset. SEM is also necessary to properly account for potential feedback mechanisms between aspects of environment and tree species diversity, which could otherwise increase the chances of Type I error and wrongly attribute inference due to the covariance of explanatory variables when using conventional regression analyses \citep{Nachtigall2003}.

We specified a conceptual model with factors expected to affect AGB: water availability, soil fertility, disturbance, tree species diversity, tree structural diversity and stem density (\autoref{con_mod}). 

Observed variables were transformed to achieve normality where necessary and standardised to Z-scores prior to analysis (Fig. S1, Fig. S2). Standardisation allows path regression coefficients to be easily compared between paths in the same model to assess their relative effect size, and eliminates confusion in model interpretation arising from the observed variables being on different scales \citep{Beaujean2014}. Standardisation also controls for variables with variation across different orders of magnitude, which could otherwise prevent adequate model estimation from the covariance matrix in `lavaan'. To ensure that observed variables within a latent variable had consistent directions of influence, some observed variables had their sign reversed. For example, overall water availability is expected to decrease as soil sand content increases, therefore sand content was reversed for use in the water availability latent variable. Precipitation seasonality, and temperature stress were also reversed in this way to account for the direction of their effect on water availability. 

The factor loadings of the observed variable assumed to contribute most to each latent variable were set to one, as per convention, with other observed variables being allowed to vary \citep{Beaujean2014}.  We tested the robustness of our assumptions with a chi-squared test of all possible combinations of observed variable factor loadings set to one, while ensuring no factor loadings were in excess of one. We found no significant difference between model specifications (p>0.05). Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) was used in each model to estimate the values of missing data in each latent variable \citep{Cham2017}.

We assessed the role of tree species diversity and tree structural diversity in determining AGB via a simple mediation model which allowed species diversity to influence AGB both directly and indirectly via structural diversity. Structural diversity can also directly influence AGB in this model, separate to the effect of of species diversity. To account for variation in stem density, which may covary with species diversity, we included it as an observed variable in our model. To explore variation in the model among woodland vegetation types, we fit the model both at the regional scale and for each vegetation type separately. We compared unstandardised path coefficients among the models for different vegetation types to understand the effect that vegetation type has on the relationship between tree species diversity, structural diversity, stem density and AGB. Path coefficients show the effect of a given path with other paths held constant. Models were estimated using the `MLM' estimator, because it is robust to multivariate non-normality \citep{Shapiro1983}. Model fit was evaluated using the robust Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the robust Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and the R\textsuperscript{2} coefficient of determination for AGB. We critically assessed model fit in each case, taking into consideration the recommendations of \citet{Hu1999} who define threshold values of acceptability for these model fit indices: CFI >0.85, TLI >0.85, RMSEA <0.15, alongside our judgement of the model estimates.

To explore the hypothesis that biodiversity effects on ecosystem function increase in strength as stem density increases, we repeatedly sub-sampled the available plot dataset to create \subn{} data subsets with similar stem density. For each data subset we separately fitted a model including tree species and structural diversity latent variables to predict AGB. As we controlled for stem density via the dataset sub-sampling process, the effect of stem density on AGB was not included in the model. We examined how the unstandardised path coefficients for each path in the SEM varied according to the median stem density of the data subsets. 

Preliminary models that included herbivore biomass \citep{Hempson2017} did not converge, possibly due to the spatially coarse nature of the available data, we therefore did not include herbivory in our final model. We incorporated environmental covariates into our model to understand the relative effects of water availability, soil fertility and disturbance on AGB both directly and indirectly via species diversity and stem density. We compared standardised path coefficients between paths in the model to understand the relative contribution of each path to explain variance in AGB. Vegetation type specific models could not be reliably fitted for this more complex model specification with environmental covariates, due to sample size issues and because some vegetation types were narrow in their climate space, leading to a lack of environmental variation, particularly in the water availability latent variable.

\section{Results}

% Correlations
Pairwise correlations between all observed variables used in the Structural Equation Models (SEMs) showed that all tree species diversity (extrapolated tree species richness, Shannon equitability index) and structural diversity (coefficients of variation of DBH and height) variables had moderate positive correlations with AGB (\autoref{corr_mat}, Fig. S3). Stem density had the strongest correlation with AGB of all variables considered (\ccib{}). Environmental variables had weaker correlations with AGB than diversity variables, with all environmental variables having significant correlations with AGB, except fire frequency. The direction of these correlations was used as a test of our assumptions for the direction of influence of latent variables later used in the SEMs. MAP had positive correlations with all tree species diversity and structural diversity variables. Tree species diversity variables had clear positive correlations with stem density (species richness: \ccsi{}; Shannon equitability: \ccei{}), but structural diversity variables showed weak correlations with stem density (DBH CoV: \ccdvi{}, Height CoV: \cchvi{}).

\subsection{Structural and species diversity models}

In an SEM describing the effect of tree species diversity on AGB via the mediating effects of tree structural diversity and stem density (\autoref{struc_mod}), species diversity showed no direct effect on AGB (\strucbetadb{}), but did have an indirect positive effect via structural diversity (\strucbetadib{}) (\autoref{struc_mod}). Model fit was good with high factor loadings for all observed variables. All other path coefficients were significant (p <0.01) (\autoref{struc_model_fit_clust_stats}). The R\textsuperscript{2} of AGB was \strucrsq{}. The strongest direct effect on AGB was from stem density (\strucbetaib{}).

\subsection{Variation among vegetation types}

When the tree species and structural diversity model (\autoref{struc_mod}) was refitted separately using data from each of the four vegetation types, we found that the effect sizes of each latent variable remained largely similar, though model fit varied. The direct effect of tree species diversity on AGB was positive and marginally significant in ex-Acacia (\strucbetacsb{}) but negligible in Mopane (\strucbetadsb{}), sparse miombo / \textit{Baikiaea} (\strucbetaasb{}) and Core miombo (\strucbetabsb{}) (\autoref{struc_model_slopes_all}). Relationships between structural diversity and AGB remained generally similar, with the same sign and overlap between the 95\% confidence intervals of path coefficients. The R\textsuperscript{2} of AGB was highest in ex-Acacia shrubland (R\textsuperscript{2} = \struccrsq{}) and lowest in sparse miombo / Baikiaea (R\textsuperscript{2} = \strucarsq{}). The total effect of species diversity on AGB remained strongly positive and there was a positive direct effect of species diversity on structural diversity, across all vegetation types. All models had adequate goodness-of-fit (\autoref{struc_model_fit_clust_stats}), though confidence intervals around the unstandardised path coefficients were wide particularly for Mopane and ex-Acacia. $\chi^{2}$ statistics were high for some vegetation types, but this appears to be highly correlated with sample size for each vegetation type \citep{Hooper2008}.


\subsection{Moderation of Diversity-AGB relationship by stem density}

In the sub-sampling of the plot dataset by stem density, we found an increasing positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB as stem density increased (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}e). There appears to be a minimum stem density threshold at c. 180 trees ha\textsuperscript{-1} below which there appears to be a reasonably constant baseline effect of tree diversity on biomass (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}b). The effect of structural diversity on AGB appears to remain constant with increasing stem density (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}d). The indirect effect of tree species diversity on AGB via structural diversity increases as stem density increases (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}c). 


\subsection{Environmental covariates and tree diversity}

A model incorporating the latent variables of water availability, soil fertility and disturbance by fire showed that the total effect of tree species diversity on biomass was similar to that of water availability, soil fertility and disturbance (\autoref{full_mod}, Fig. S4). The direct effects of water availability, soil fertility and disturbance on AGB were negligible (water: \fmbetamb{}, soil: \fmbetasb{}, disturbance: \fmbetafb{}), with nearly all of their observed effects on AGB coming from the indirect paths via stem density (water: \fmbetamib{}, soil: \fmbetasib{}, disturbance: \fmbetafib{}) and species diversity (water: \fmbetamd{}, soil: \fmbetasd{}, disturbance: \fmbetafd{}). MAP and soil sand content had the greatest contributions to the latent variable of water availability. Model fit was acceptable: CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.900, and RMSEA = \fmrmsea{}, R\textsuperscript{2} of AGB = \fmrsq{}. 

Similar to the model that only considered tree species and structural diversity (\autoref{struc_mod}), the direct effect of species diversity on structural diversity was positive, while structural diversity itself had a positive effect on AGB, leading to a strong positive indirect effect of species diversity on AGB via structural diversity (\fmbetadhb{}) when environmental covariates were accounted for. Again, the direct effect of species diversity on AGB was negligible (\fmbetadb{}). The total effect of species diversity on AGB was positive (\fmbetatotaldb{}). Compared to the simple model with no environmental covariates, the total explanatory power of tree species diversity and structural diversity in this model decreased, but the predictive power of the model as a whole increased.


\section{Discussion}

% Re-cap
We assessed the importance of a) tree species diversity, b) tree structural diversity, c) resource availability, d) disturbance by fire, e) stem density and their interactions on above-ground woody biomass (AGB) across southern African savannas and woodlands, using a network of \nplots{} woodland plots in conjunction with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). We found support for a general positive relationship between tree species diversity and AGB, operating indirectly via structural diversity (H\textsubscript{1}). Tree species diversity, structural diversity and stem density accounted for \smrsq{}\% of the variation in AGB across the region, while models for specific vegetation types showed even greater explanatory power in some cases (\autoref{struc_model_fit_clust_stats}). Within the latent variable of tree species diversity we found similarly strong factor loadings for both species richness and abundance evenness. This demonstrates that species richness and abundance evenness measure different and largely uncorrelated aspects of diversity. We found that the effect of tree species diversity on AGB increased with stem density (H\textsubscript{2}), with an apparent threshold of 180 stems ha\textsuperscript{-1} >10 cm DBH, below which the effect of species diversity on AGB remained at a low baseline level. The strongest direct effect on AGB was that of stem density. When the effects of water availability, soil fertility and disturbance by fire were controlled for, the total explanatory power of tree species diversity and structural diversity decreased, but the predictive power of the model increased, suggesting that it is important to control for environmental covariates to understand the true effect of tree species diversity on AGB in regional scale assessments in southern African woodlands.

\subsection{Inter-related effects of tree species and structural diversity on AGB}

We found a consistent positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB. Within southern African woodlands we therefore find support for the hypothesis that higher tree species richness and evenness leads to higher above-ground woody biomass. This finding is in agreement with many other studies across different ecosystems and biomes, supporting the idea that there is a generalisable positive association between biodiversity and ecosystem function \citep{Liang2016, Cardinale2009}. Our study provides a novel dissection of the mechanisms underlying this relationship, particularly in the context of southern African woodlands, a disturbance-driven and poorly studied ecological system.

Much of the total variation in AGB was driven by variation in stem density. It is possible that within southern African woodlands a higher species diversity allows for a higher stem density through niche separation, which reduces competition between species occupying varying niche space, leading to an increase in total AGB per unit area. The opposite causation is also plausible however, with increased stem density causing higher species richness through an increased probability of encountering new species. We attempted to correct for the correlation between species richness and stem density using extrapolated species richness, which extrapolates a rarefaction curve to its predicted asymptote, thus estimating the total landscape-level species richness which is independent of plot size and stem density. We suggest therefore that an increase in tree species diversity through species richness and evenness produces an assemblage of species which can utilise more available light and moisture, resulting in greater plot-level AGB. This is supported by the moderately strong indirect positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB via structural diversity, and the positive effect of water availability on AGB via stem density in the model which included environmental covariates. 

We found evidence that tree species diversity led to an increase in AGB indirectly via tree structural diversity, and we therefore find support for our second hypothesis H\textsubscript{2}. A higher tree species diversity allows for a greater structural diversity of trees, i.e. greater variation in DBH and height. This may act as a mechanism for niche complementarity, with a canopy of diversely sized trees able to take advantage of a greater proportion of the available light. Although we did not measure them here, we would also expect that tree species diversity allows for a greater range of tree functional forms \citep{Pretzsch2014}, i.e. wider variation in canopy shape and overall growth form; broad flat crowns vs. narrow deep crowns, for example. In forests, where the tree canopy is effectively closed, as the stand matures a more diverse canopy emerges via competition and tree mortality events which open canopy gaps \citep{Muscolo2014}. Indeed, our finding that the strength of the effect of tree diversity on AGB increases with stem density supports this mechanism. In frequently disturbed woodlands such as those studied here however, a woodland canopy similar to that of a forest is frequently not reached. Instead, a simple open canopy is maintained that can be made more complex and productive via an increase in species diversity. Previous studies have found that southern African woodlands with higher species diversity tend to experience less frequent disturbance by fire and tend to form a more closed canopy and a more sparse understorey \citep{Chidumayo2013, Mutowo2012}. In our study however, we found a positive effect of fire frequency on species diversity, perhaps suggesting that disturbance prevents domination of woodlands by a single dominant species \citep{Chidumayo2013}.

We found a non-linear positive effect of stem density on the relationship between tree species diversity and AGB (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}). At low stem densities, competition between mature trees may not occur, meaning that the niche complementarity effect provided by an increase in tree species richness may not be present, accounting for the small effect of tree species diversity on AGB below c. 180 trees ha\textsuperscript{-1}. At very high stem density, there is an increase in the effect of species diversity on structural diversity. This could be because at high stem density, the adaptation of different species to growth form become important. At low stem density, individual trees tend to spread out rather than growing tall, but at high stem density, only certain species are able to exist in the understorey, while others are able to grow tall above the woodland canopy, leading to greater variation in tree height over the plot.


\subsection{Effects of water availability, soil fertility and disturbance}

Water availability had a positive total effect on AGB, comparable in size to the total effect of tree species diversity on AGB, while soil fertility had a negative total effect. We expected that higher water availability and soil fertility would lead to higher AGB under the assumption that higher resource availability would allow for a greater stem density per unit area, greater productivity per unit area and additionally greater tree species diversity due to niche partitioning \citep{Kraaij2006, Shirima2015}. Previous studies in tropical forests have shown that water availability increases AGB both directly and indirectly via increasing tree species diversity and via increasing stand structural diversity \citep{Ali2019a, Ali2019b, Poorter2017}. In this study, we observed indirect positive effects of water availability on AGB via species diversity and a positive but only marginally significant direct effect on AGB. Compared to moist tropical forests, water availability is more of a limiting factor to tree growth in southern African woodlands, which experience frequent drought. 

Disturbance by fire had a negative total effect on AGB, with most of this negative effect coming from the indirect pathway via stem density. This is expected as increased fire frequency is a key mechanism by which mesic savannas maintain an open canopy, rather than shift to a closed canopy forest \citep{Staver2011}. There were small positive effects of disturbance by fire on tree species diversity, a finding which is supported by studies elsewhere \citep{Durigan2020, Staver2009}. It is suggested that in mesic savannas where the tree-species pool is largely adapted to fire, increased fire may actually increase tree species diversity by allowing weak competitors to co-exist. 

A negative total effect of soil fertility on AGB is in contrast to other studies in the region and against general ecological theory, which predicts a positive effect of soil nutrients on biomass citep{}. The negative total effect of soil fertility on AGB was driven mostly by an indirect negative effect via stem density. The direct effect on AGB however, remained positive and marginally significant, as expected. Model estimates of the effect of soil on AGB were poorly constrained compared with other latent variables. This wide standard error on the model predictions is possibly due to the coarseness and nature of the soil data we used. SoilGrids provides modelled data at 250 m resolution, while soil structure and nutrient content varies at much finer scales in southern African woodlands \citep{Muledi2017, Bucini2007}, notably by termite mounds which offer small areas of highly fertile soil with peculiar tree species diversity \citep{Joseph2014}. It is therefore not surprising that this model path is poorly constrained. \citet{Lehmann2014} found similarly weak and poorly constrained relationships for soil in a Structural Equation Model including precipitation, temperature, soil, and fire to predict tree basal area in southern African woodlands. Plot-specific soil data are time-consuming to collect and difficult to compare across studies when different protocols are used. Our study points to the need for further effort in this regard, which may reveal interesting findings about the complex interactions between soil, disturbance and tree diversity in southern African woodlands.

\subsection{Vegetation type responses}

All four vegetation types produced similar results in the simple SEM, with a positive total effect of species diversity on AGB, the majority being indirectly via structural diversity. This demonstrates the robustness of our results, showing they are generalisable across vegetation types in southern Africa. It also demonstrates that similar ecosystem processes are occurring in these vegetation types, despite variation in species composition, overall species richness and mean biomass.

Core miombo and sparse miombo / Baikiaea woodland vegetation exhibited a small negative direct effect of tree species diversity on AGB, while the total effect, incorporating the indirect effect via structural diversity, remained positive in these vegetation types. Compared to ex-Acacia and Mopane woodlands, miombo woodlands have higher median tree species richness. Ex-Acacia and Mopane woodlands are dominated by fewer tree species, notably \textit{Senegalia} spp. in ex-Acacia woodlands and \textit{Colophospermum mopane} in Mopane woodlands, which can produce large canopy dominating trees in the so-called ``Cathedral mopane''. We postulate that the slight negative effect of tree species richness on AGB in miombo woodlands may be due to an increase in interspecific competition through canopy crowding, but that this effect is not present in ex-Acacia and Mopane woodlands, where the top level of the woodland canopy is dominated often by a single species. 

Higher functional redundancy among tree species in miombo woodlands may lead to smaller trees with lower AGB in the most diverse plots, more resembling thicket vegetation and suppressing the few species which tend to create high biomass, such as \textit{Julbernadia} and \textit{Brachystegia} spp.. In the species-poor Mopane and ex-Acacia woodlands however, the addition of extra species may fill a greater proportional niche space, thus increasing total AGB more. 

Despite Mopane woodland having very low species diversity generally, with often monospecific stands \citep{Timberlake2010}, a positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB was observed. In previous studies across ecosystem types it has been found often that the effect on ecosystem function of adding species is stronger in low diversity assemblages \citep{Cardinale2006, Srivastava2005}. This has been attributed to an increase in functional redundancy as species diversity increases. In other words, with more species, it is more likely that the addition of a new species will occupy the same ecological niche space as an existing species, meaning niche complementarity will not occur and competition will not lead to niche partitioning, making little difference to overall ecosystem functioning. Mopane woodlands also have a negligible effect of species diversity on structural diversity. This may be due to the species which tend to co-exist with \textit{C. mopane}, many of which are small shrub-like trees and which do not grow into large canopy trees \citep{Timberlake2010}. Larger canopy trees tend to have greater variation in physical structure \citep{Seidel2019}. 

Ex-Acacia woodlands showed the strongest total effect of species diversity on AGB and was the only vegetation type to show a significant positive direct effect of species diversity on AGB. Ex-Acacia woodlands also had relatively low median species richness compared to miombo, but the addition of new species appears to make a larger difference to the AGB of these plots than in Mopane woodlands. We suggest that this is due mostly to the particular identity of species found in ex-Acacia woodlands and their contribution to ecosystem functioning. Unlike Mopane woodlands, ex-Acacia woodlands contain a wider variety of species which can grow to large canopy trees, albeit at low densities, especially in transition zones with miombo woodlands. Additionally, many more species species in ex-Acacia woodlands are found in the Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae sub-families, of which most are nitrogen-fixing \citep{Tedersoo2018}. Nitrogen availability is often a limiting factor in productivity, making nitrogen-fixing species strong competitors. It is possible that in ex-Acacia dominated woodlands, the presence of a large number of nitrogen-fixing tree species reduces functional redundancy, meaning that the effect of adding species on ecosystem function saturates at a higher species richness.

\section{Conclusions}

In this study we found that even in highly disturbed southern African woodlands, there exists a generalisable positive association between tree species diversity and ecosystem function, quantified as above-ground woody biomass (AGB). 
Our findings contribute to our understanding of a universal biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship, one which is moderated in a predictable manner by environmental covariates and their interaction with biodiversity and ecosystem structure.
We found that the multiple vegetation types which comprise southern African woodlands exhibit similarities in the relationship between species diversity and woody biomass, suggesting that similar  processes operate across the region to determine ecosystem function. 
We advocate for explicit inclusion of environmental covariates in regional scale models of biodiversity and ecosystem function. We assert that this is necessary to develop our understanding of the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship in real-world ecosystems, to progress from experimental mesocosms.
We found that much of the effect of species diversity on biomass exists as an indirect effect by increasing the structural diversity of trees, exemplifying a key vector through which tree species diversity determines ecosystem function in savannas, woodlands and forests, i.e. all wooded ecosystems.
The presence of a stem density threshold above which the effect of tree species diversity on AGB increases clearly implies the presence of niche complementarity effects in southern African woodlands, an aspect which has often been overlooked in previous studies despite its intuitive logic as a determinant of niche complementarity effects in wooded ecosystems.
Our study shows that biodiversity change through extensive human actions in this region will have the greatest negative impact on ecosystem function in areas of high stem density, and low species diversity, which are those areas predominantly targeted for tree felling. This raises concerns about the robustness of these ecosystems to further resource extraction and biodiversity loss.
